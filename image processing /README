## `image_processing_scripts`

Matlab and shell scripts written for image preprocessing, automated lesion delineation and data extraction. They all work on image level and require DICOM or NIFTI file input. Output are text files.

## Software requirements

Running the bash scripts requires the FMRIB Software Library, Release 6.0 (c) 2018, The University of Oxford (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Licence). 
Additional software if needed is mentioned in the reference section of each script.
