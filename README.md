# ADC thresholds for automated lesion delineation study

Code and data for "A comparison between automated, threshold-based acute ischemic stroke lesion delineation and expert manual delineation" study

Authors: Vitus Gosch, Doctoral Candidate – Center for Stroke Research Berlin, Charité Universitaetsmedizin Berlin

## Background
This repository contains bash, matlab and R scripts for image preprocessing, automated lesion delineation and statistical analysis. It provides data used for the study. 

## Structure

### **`data`** 
All raw data collected from your experiments as well as copies of the transformed data from your processing code. 

### **`image processing`** 
Files that may not be code, but are important for reproducibility of your findings.
* **`protocols`**: A well annotated and general description of your experiments. These protocols should be descriptive enough for someone to follow your experiments independently 
* **`materials`**: Information regarding the materials used in your experiments or data generation. This could include manufacturer information, records of purity, and/or lot and catalog numbers.
* **`software details`**: Information about your computational environment that are necessary for others to execute your code. This includes details about your operating system, software version and required packages.

### **`statistical analysis`** 
All test suites for your code. *Any custom code you've written should be thoroughly and adequately tested to make sure you know how it is working.*

### **`figures`** 
Custom code you've written that is *not* executed directly, but is called from files in the `code` directory. If you've written your code in Python, for example, this can be the root folder for your custom software module or simply house a file with all of your functions. 
 


1. **`LICENSE`**: A legal protection of your work. *It is important to think deeply about the licensing of your work, and is not a decision to be made lightly.

2. **`README.md`**: A descriptive yet succinct description of your research project and information regarding the structure outlined below.
